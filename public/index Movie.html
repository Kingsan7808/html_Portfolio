<h1>The best Movies According to Me</h1>

<h2>Top 3 movies</h2>

<hr />

<h3>1. Avatar</h3>

<p>It's an awesome and very well made movie with an original, beautiful, epic, exciting, interesting, creative,<br />
   imaginative, absorbing, deep, touching, perfect and well thought and structured story, charged with action <br />
   scenes and with epic and spectacular fights, wars and battles, love, dramatic and emotional scenes, interesting <br />
   and cool things, etc., rich in details, with all its elements, components and designs very cool, beautiful <br />
   and splendid (the universe in which the movie is set, the world of Pandora, the Na’vi, Eywa; the Na’vi <br />
   lifestyle, ways, culture and religion, characters, creatures, flora, vehicles, weapons, clothing and ornaments,<br />
   places, landscapes, the avatars and the Avatar Program, etc.), with great performances of actors, with an <br />
   excellent, beautiful, emotional, sensational and thrilling music (or soundtrack) and more than just <br />
   impressive, dazzling and innovative special effects, which are accompanied by highly advanced and innovative<br />
   technology that makes the movie visually and technically extraordinary and wonderful for the motion capture,<br />
   especially face capture, computer animation and 3D, among other things. All these things fascinate me so <br />
   much. Moreover, it has everything or almost everything I want and can imagine in any movie, especially in a <br />
   science fiction movie, and much more.</p>
   <p>It contains many themes and elements, as well as all or almost all themes and aspects of life: love, <br />
    friendship, family, fraternity, loyalty, spiritual goodness and purity, nature and environment, biodiversity, <br />
    forests and jungles, cultures, indigenous cultures and peoples; colonization and defense of that peoples, <br />
    or in this case, of planets and races; defense and preservation of the environment; defense of homes, goods<br />
    and rights; the life, the interior and the conscience of the protagonist (his thoughts, his decisions, his <br />
    will, his journey, his personal conflict, his problems, etc.); meaning of life, universe, existence and <br />
    beyond; divine presence, belief and power; life in a perfect, wonderful and paradisiacal world full of life,<br />
    natural resources, etc. (although also dangerous and hostile, in the case of Pandora); love for that kind <br />
    of world and for special people and their way of life; relations and communications between different persons, <br />
    peoples, individuals, races, societies, civilizations, etc.; bonds and connection with and between all <br />
    living things, bonds between human people, animals and plants, bonds and love between loved ones, connection <br />
    with the world and with superior things, contact and connection with nature, avarice or greed, conflict, <br />
    oppression, exploitation, discrimination, hope, trust, betrayal, courage, strength, survival, adaptation, <br />
    learning, journey, discovery, exploration; fight for good, survival and salvation; redemption, distinction <br />
    between weak and strong, transhumanism, biology, science, technology, scientific and technological advances, <br />
    science fiction and fantasy themes and elements, etc., as interracial love and sex, I mean, between humans <br />
    and aliens, as it is shown in this movie between the two lover protagonists, which are a male human and a <br />
    female alien, or rather, the man is a human who is driving a remotely controlled Na'vi body or avatar (Jake)<br />
    and the woman is one flesh and blood Na'vi (Neytiri). But the movie is much better having the extended<br /> 
    version on DVD or Blu-Ray cause even being Na'vi sex (and other things by the same) there are also human <br />
    love and sex.</p>

    <h3>2. Jurassic World</h3>

    <p>It took me a very long time to figure out my favorite movie. I think after all this time I finally settled <br />
        on Jurassic Park. There is really nothing wrong I can find with that movie. Sure the science is faulty, but<br />
        it still follows the logic of its own science. I felt like talking about it because I recently watched a <br />
        Lindsay Ellis video and she said something that surprised me a bit.</p>
    <p>She said some brief quip implying that Jurassic Park does a lousy job with Dr. Alan Grant because it never <br />
        explains why he hates children.</p>
    <p>Adults hate children all the time for the sheer reason that they're children. I don't need a tragic backstory <br />
        explaining why Dr. Grant hates kids. One of the first scenes at the dino dig adequately illustrates this. <br />
        That kid called a velociraptor a giant turkey and Grant's reaction shows why he hates kids. He thinks they <br />
        are ungrateful and irritating.</p>
    <p>But moving onto the main post, I love Jurassic Park because it's that perfect balance of blockbuster magic and <br />
        smart filmmaking. Yes, there are giant dinosaurs running around eating people who are screaming and yelling, <br />
        but there is also the artistry behind it. There are messages both on the nose ("Life, uh, finds a way") that <br />
        are perfectly acted and more subtle messages that make you think.</p>
    <p>Near the beginning of the movie, Dr. Grant talks about how birds might have evolved from dinosaurs. Everyone else<br />
         kind of chuckles at this, and he defends himself on the theory.</p>
    <p>The core of the movie is about trying to bring back an extinct species with the miracle of science, and it goes<br />
         horribly wrong. The final shot of the film is Dr. Grant looking out the window of the helicopter and seeing <br />
         pelicans flying. It's very subtle, but the movie is saying that the miracle of science is right in front of<br />
          him - evolution. The fact that dinosaurs somehow "survived" through evolution was the real miracle all along.<br />
           (Insert "maybe the real X was the Y we made along the way" joke here).</p>
    <p>I read the book and still love the movie way more. The book had parts that were too on-the-nose. Ian Malcom was<br />
         basically a self-insert of Michael Crichton trying to preach to the choir. Ian Malcom in the movie was way more <br />
         natural. In the book, Dr. Grant's adventures with the kids felt really boring because there was no conflict or <br />
         awkwardness between them. Since he loves kids, there was nothing to really worry about. That's why I feel Dr. Grant <br />
         hating kids in the movie puts a twist on the adventure because it adds more friction and humor. At the very end of the<br />
          movie, Dr. Grant is sitting with the two kids and smiling at Ellie. In short, I felt like there was character <br />
          development in the movie but not in the book, funny enough. Usually you think it would be the opposite. The<br />
           characters in the movie also felt more distinct rather than just "the protagonists" in the book.</p>

    <h3>3. The Super Mario Bros.</h3>  
    
    <p>“The Super Mario Bros. Movie” is without a doubt one of the best video game adaptations made yet. This film is<br />
         faithful to the original series through its references to older and newer material, has a good story, great character<br />
          moments and arguably the best animation that Illumination has ever put out. Despite the cast being comprised of <br />
          established actors, the voice acting is phenomenal. Surprisingly, Chris Pratt does a respectable job as Mario. However,<br />
           the best performance in this film is Jack Black’s Bowser. Black brings so much life to the character that the performance<br />
            can easily be compared to Bowser’s personality in the Mario RPG series. Even when Bowser starts singing, Black brings so<br />
             much personality that the character feels perfect.</p>
    <p>Charlie Day’s performance as Luigi is also great, perfectly reflecting Luigi’s cowardice in a way that makes his character shine.<br />
         It is a shame we don’t get to see more of Luigi in the movie, outside of the first half and the final battle. Keegan Michael Key<br />
          gives Toad more character, which is the best move Illumination Entertainment could’ve made. Anya Taylor Joy’s Princess Peach is<br />
         fantastic and honestly diverges the most from her video game counterpart in terms of personality, but Joy makes it work in the best<br />
         way possible. Seth Rogen’s Donkey Kong is just okay; there isn’t much to say about him, sadly.</p>
    <p>Visually, this movie is amazing. Illumination really went all out with the animation here. “The Super Mario Bros. Movie” is also<br />
        filled to the brim with references from the series as well as other Nintendo properties. From locations to characters and enemies,<br />
         Illumination Entertainment really put everything they could into its short runtime.</p>
    <p>The plot of this movie is, unfortunately, paper thin. It’s not to say “The Super Mario Bros. Movie” has a bad story, but there’s<br />
        not much that really goes on in the film from a storyline perspective. It doesn’t have many turning points or explanations for <br />
        certain aspects of the Mushroom Kingdom, for example. The movie attempts to develop the characters, but it ends up feeling rushed<br />
         and it only pushes the movie forward.</p>
    <p>Part of the reasoning behind this issue was the movie’s pacing. This movie is only an hour and a half long. It can be argued that<br />
         the first “Sonic the Hedgehog” movie was around the same length as the Mario movie, but the difference is that the Sonic movie took <br />
         its time to reach its end goal and developed Sonic’s character over the course of the film and into the sequel.</p>
    <p>The issue with Mario and Luigi’s development is that, toward the finale, it doesn’t feel like they’ve grown into this role, especially<br />
         Luigi, who is hardly in the film’s second act.</p>
    <p>Is this film worth seeing despite the criticism? Absolutely. Regardless of what’s been said, “The Super Mario Bros. Movie” is still an<br />
        incredibly fun and enjoyable film for fans and moviegoers. As far as video game movie adaptations are concerned, “The Super Mario Bros. <br />
        Movie” is iconic for fans of the original series and a must-see. It’s the best we’ve gotten thus far.</p>
